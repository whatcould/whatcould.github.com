Just boggles the mind, really, how anyone could write a test suite that wouldn't fail somewhere along the line if they *left out some database columns*. If your tests are that bad, maybe ya shoulda written better tests to start with. You know, instead of adding a one-liner to see if you actually added the column.

Or, how about a metaphor. Let's say you're testing a car. If you like @should_have_db_columns@, you'll *love* @should_have_all_four_wheels@. Though some would say: even without that test, you'd eventually realize a wheel was gone.
