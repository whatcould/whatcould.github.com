title: SVG on my new site. (Kinda.)

h1. {{ page.title }}

p(meta). 25 March 2009

I've been stiching together the pieces of a "site redux":http://wisconsinbutterflies.org -- from PHP in 2005, to Rails in 2009. Of course I'm not just switching frameworks for the hell of it; I'm adding features in the rewrite.

Anyway, the site includes a state map that shows dynamically updated information by county. The old maps were pretty ugly, so I thought I'd give SVG a stab. (I'd rather not use Flash, for various ideological reasons.)

h2. Brief rundown of what I learned

* A detailed SVG state map makes "Firefox run like molasses":#firefox (see below)
* Imagemagick will turn your SVG files into PNG bitmaps... "badly":#imagemagick.
* "librsvg":http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/, which comes with a command-line tool (rsvg), is "what you really want":#librsvg.

h2. The details

h3(#firefox). Firefox does SVG, but not happily

The maps on the site display location information for insect species, by county -- each county can be filled with one of a number of colors. The old maps were GIF files, and had to be bitmap-filled with GD in PHP (think _paint bucket_). Old school, right? So I got an SVG version of the map, and after a little bit I was filling in the counties with a touch of javascript. I reference the SVG file in an object tag, so I can cache the blank file in the browser and just color

Only problem (besides IE compatability, I suppose) was that you put the map in Firefox and it slows the scrolling down to a crawl, and the lightbox-style image zoom I had on the page became comically slow.

Here's the map, without any county fill colors:

<object id="wisc" name="wisc" data="/images/wisconsin.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="320px" height="320px">
</object>

If you're on Firefox... it looks fine, right? And I could attach click effects to the counties, which would be helpful. But: the counties should have hover effects, but they seem to be barely working. And try to scroll the page in Firefox. Oh, and it doesn't work in *Safari*. Or Internet Explorer, which is less of an issue for me -- I was already planning to serve "those people" alternate content.

h3(#imagemagick). Imagemagick makes ugly PNGs from SVG

Plan B. Since I'd already figured out how to edit the SVG files dynamically, I went about creating bitmap copies on demand, on the server. With "Hpricot":http://wiki.github.com/why/hpricot, I can add fill colors to the SVG XML file, and then I just needed an SVG rasterizer.

Imagemagick can do it, and it was already installed on my server. But its interpretation left a lot to be desired -- the scale is off, and for some reason some of the paths are very thick:

<code>convert -resize 274x300 species_15.svg species_15_imagemagick.png</code>
<p><img src="/images/species_15_imagemagick.png" /></p>

h3(#librsvg). Librsvg for fun and profit

Turns out "librsvg":http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/ is much more adept, at least at my particular SVG image. After a bit of hair-pulling, I managed to get it compiled. (You need GTK+, but not the whole X11/XFree86 setup.) Initially I worried about finding Ruby bindings, but it turns out it comes with a command-line tool.

<code>rsvg --width=274 --height=300 original.svg bitmap.png</code>

<p><img src="/images/wi-locations-clouded-sulphur.png" /></p>

Much better, right? Still would like to make the map interactive -- to be able to click on the county. Pretty depressing that in 2009, there is no good way to do that with free tools.

If you're interested, here's the "page on the new site":http://wisconsinbutterflies.org/butterfly/species/15-clouded-sulphur with the image in context.
